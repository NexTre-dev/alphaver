## Description
Cut content(?)

"This was a rare event that [5] and [2] proposed once. [0], as per his policy, wanted them to justify its presence in the game besides cosmetic reasons, so they upped the difficulty."

"I am unsure if it made it into Lilypad, and I don't really want to check now, it takes too long for this event to normally appear"



"It's insensitive of some of you to impersonate someone who's not with us anymore."
"And hadn't been for a long while, [2] was the oldest person in the developer team"

## Characters
* dev2
* samurai_2001:
  * dev2 is speaking to them.
  * The desktop suggests that this is the same player from [Version 13](version-13.md).

## Events & Anomalies
* The audio is a track that wasn't heard anywhere before [OST_2.7z's release](../resources/ost_2-7z.md). The first track is [Denmark](../resources/ost_2/denmark.md), which seemlessly switches to [Sunrise at Denmark](../resources/ost_2/sunrise-at-denmark.md) when the shattered moon appears on-screen. The track when the nebula appears remains unknown.
* ~0:22: There is a weird nametag looking thing, could be a compression artifact, could be not.

* 0:24:58: The moon looks strange, it looks like it has been shattered in half.
* 0:50:34: The sun also looks strange -- it appears to be the Crab Nebula from the [paintings](../resources/paintings.md).
* 0:50:34: dev2 is seen next to an iron door.
* 1:08:22: dev2 says `hope you're happy, samurai_2001`.
